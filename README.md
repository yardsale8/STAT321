## Original source of this repo

This repo is a fork of the [r-python](https://github.com/binder-examples/r_with_python.git), which builds on the [r binder](https://github.com/binder-examples/r) and [jupyter lab binder](https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyterlab) and is complementary to the [multi-language-demo binder](https://github.com/binder-examples/multi-language-demo) with examples on using both R and python in both Jupyter Lab and RStudio.
